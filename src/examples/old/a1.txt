This is a demo of the
Gray Plus and Gray
Minus keys.

Use these keys to step
to the 'next' and
'previous' changes
in this pair of files.

Note that the word
'next' means "the
first changed line
after the next un-
changed line".  Thus,
if you are currently
positioned within (or
at the start of) a
long changed block
(and of course,
'changed' implies
'deletes' and 'inserts'
as well as 'changes'),
the Gray Plus will step
you past the end of
the entire block, and
past the ensuing un-
changed block of lines
as well, and will position
you at the start of the
next set of changes
after that.

OK, here is the start
of a block of 'unchanged'
text.
It goes on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on.
