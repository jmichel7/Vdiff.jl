\proclaim I\s5-1. Reduction of two variable quadratic forms. 

We can always choose an arbitrary visible vector to be a vector basis. 
For the 2-dimensional lattice $L$ we choose a shortest vector $\vec s\in 
S$. Then the other basis vector must be in one the two $\Sigma_\pm$ the 
nearest paralleles to $\lambda\vec s$ which contain lattice points
