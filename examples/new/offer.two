Dear friend,


You have not heard much from OPENetwork because it has taken us much longer 
than we expected to revamp DELTA.  Since you are probably a programmer, 
this is not too surprising. We have a very small team and have to earn a 
living by consulting on other projects.

We are now releasing 2 new versions of DELTA, each with a new interface 
and much higher size limits.

 *   a completeley revamped version for DOS, called DELTA 2

 *   a Windows version, called DELTA for Windows
 
 With both versions, you can customize the colors, explore bigger files or 
directories than previously possible and in general go about your business 
in the smoothest possible manner.

Each of this products lists for $ 100.00, but we are happy to offer you 
an upgrade of your current DELTA for $ 40.00 each. As always, we offer a 
30 day money back guarantee, but are much more interested in your feedback 
than anything else.

The comparison business is very arcane and technical, and we have not been 
very profitable, but we are hanging in there, confident that our tools 
can and will help you and many other programmers.

Yours Truly,





Jean-Claude Chetrit, President
Stephan Lugert, V.P.
John Lowenthal, programmer of DELTA (up to 1.26) and DELTA for Windows
Jean Michel, programmer of diff and DELTA 2
